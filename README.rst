Differences between SearXNG and CuteXNG
=======================================

The main difference of SearXNG and CuteXNG is that CuteXNG tries to improve on the UI aspect of SearXNG while being cute. 

There's also oneko built in!

I also do my best to be up to date from upstream so I don't miss patches!
